## Core Features:

- Model Training: Visual interface to train YOLO models using user-provided datasets and configurable hyperparameters.
- Real-time Training Progress: Display real-time training metrics such as current epoch, loss, and mAP, along with a training evolution graph.
- Trained Model Management: Ability to download the final trained model and display final metrics (precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95).
- Model Testing Interface: Test models on video sources (webcam, upload, RTSP) with real-time detection visualization and adjustable confidence thresholds.
- Video Sources Management: Add and manage different video sources including RTSP cameras with connection testing and stream preview capabilities.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#DC2626) for main actions and active states, symbolizing focus and real-time processing.
- Background color: Almost black (#0A0A0A) to create a modern and minimalist look, emphasizing the visual data.
- Accent color: Amber (#FBFF24) for secondary actions and highlights, providing a contrast that guides the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean and modern user interface.
- Monospace font: 'Fira Code' for code and logs display, ensuring readability and consistency.
- Use a minimalist layout with clear sections for upload, configuration, visualization, and metrics.
- Subtle transitions for theme switching (light + dark) and loading states, improving UX and providing feedback to the user.
